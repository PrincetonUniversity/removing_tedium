# Final Thoughts

+ Suppress Duo by using either a VPN or the multiplexing approach. 

+ Use SSH keys to login without entering your password.

+ Use aliases and shell functions to save time. Be conscious of the commands you are running and create new aliases and shell functions when appropriate.

+ Navigate the command line using keyboard shortcuts such as [Ctrl]+[a] and [Ctrl]+[e].

+ The more proficient you are with vim or emacs, the faster you will be able to work.

+ Bypass the wall time limits imposed on jobs by using Slurm job dependencies to run continuously.

+ Write your own utilities to automate your research work. Combine these utilities with system commands to construct a pipeline.

   The better your scripting skills, the better you will be at automating your work.
   Strengthen your abilities and knowledge of scripting by learning more about Python, R or Bash.

   Don't get caught up in the technical challenges. Start by thinking about the inputs and outputs. **Imagination plays a
   far more important role in identifying tasks to automate than having lots of technical knowledge.**
   
+ When you reduce the number of monotonous tasks, you will have more time to concentrate on the real work.
