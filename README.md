# Removing the Tedium from Your Research Workflow

## About

This guide presents techniques to automate the various monotonous tasks that arise while carrying out computational research. Automation saves time and reduces errors. Learn about suppressing Duo, password-less logins, aliases and shell functions, symbolic links, running a job for months without manually resubmitting, writing custom Python and R utilities, and automating your data analysis so that the newest results are presented to you at a time of your choosing.
