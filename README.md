# Removing the Tedium from Your Research Workflow

## About

Are you tired of DUO? Do you waste time entering your password every time you log in or do a file transfer? Do you want to automate repetitive tasks? This workshop will show participants how to remove much of the tedium that arises while performing computational research. Learn about suppressing Duo, password-less logins, aliases and shell functions, symbolic links, running a job for months without manually resubmitting, writing custom Python and R utilities, and automating your data analysis so that the newest results are presented to you at a time of your choosing.
